## Note on scroll animation for the shavings
The instructions explained that both the chisel and the shaving should move up as the user scrolled down, however, the .psd file showed the shaving image located at the top of the page. Assuming this is its starting position and that having both elements move in the same direction makes the animation look a little stiff, it looked better to have one go up while the other goes down.

I don't know if that was the original intention, but let me know if it was not. The default position can be easily restored.
